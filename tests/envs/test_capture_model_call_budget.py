"""The per-session model-call budget.

Written because the thing it replaces was imaginary. `agent.build.steps` is a real key in opencode's
schema and is simply not honoured -- measured against a fake engine that always asks for one more
tool call, `steps=3`, `maxSteps=3` and no setting at all each produced 61 model calls. So the tests
that matter here are the two that distinguish a real cap from a decorative one: that the (n+1)th call
is never forwarded, and that it never enters the capture graph.
