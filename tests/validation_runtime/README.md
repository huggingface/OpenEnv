# Reproducing runtime validation

This project locks the shared fixture and test toolchain separately from the main
repository. It uses Python **3.12.13**, uv **0.9.3**, a digest-pinned Python image,
and a hash-checked dependency wheelhouse. Install those Python and uv versions
first; CI installs both explicitly. Run from the repository root:

```bash
uv sync --project tests/validation_runtime --frozen
uv run --project tests/validation_runtime --frozen python scripts/validation/reproduce.py --suite fast --require-complete
uv run --project tests/validation_runtime --frozen python scripts/validation/reproduce.py --suite protocol --require-complete
uv run --project tests/validation_runtime --frozen python scripts/validation/reproduce.py --suite docker --require-complete
```

The Docker suite requires a running Linux Docker engine. Missing Docker is a
failure. The reference job uses Linux x86-64; Docker Desktop arm64 uses the same
recipe but records its different platform. No host Python code from the subject
is imported by the validator.

The protocol suite also exercises the installed wheel over real loopback HTTP
and WebSocket connections using a test-only process provider. It verifies
authorized session telemetry, full collection/grading/reporting, and process
cleanup on CPU-only Hugging Face Jobs. Its evidence explicitly records process
isolation; it does not qualify Docker, resource or network isolation. No Hub or
GitHub credentials are needed by those tests.

The Docker suite snapshots the current source, builds its exact OpenEnv wheel,
and installs that wheel into this dedicated non-editable test environment. It
downloads only binary dependencies selected from the committed lock for the
Docker platform using compatibility tags queried from the pinned base image,
records those tags, verifies dependency hashes, and installs them in the fixture image
with networking disabled. A cold cache is supported. The tests run outside the
checkout with `PYTHONPATH` removed, exercising installed package data and the
production OpenEnv `/ws` endpoint. Each launch uses a fresh subject.

The image includes controlled faults for malformed observations/rewards/state,
startup and timeout failures, ignored seeds, session drift, missing/mismatched
records, tool/task declarations, rubric configuration and child attribution.
`judged_stable` and `judged_noisy` exercise the bounded judge procedure. All fault
switches and wire corruption remain inside test assets with one public runtime plan.

The fixture registers two real MCP tools and declares task counts of four train
and two test tasks. Its task listing returns only one preview item; the collector
uses `num_tasks` and samples at most two items per split. Empty tool declarations
are checked through a real empty FastMCP registry. `discovery.json` preserves raw
results and distinguishes failed discovery from an empty success. The protocol
suite contains 35 required cases, including real tool calls and discovery/rubric
faults through the installed-wheel process provider.

Repeatability checks compare the original episode against a fresh session and an
independently inspected fresh container, then exercise a different seed. Controlled
judge fixtures use exactly 20 identical-input samples and per-step population
variance; they make no inference calls. `replays.json` retains each trace, subject
telemetry, container identity and cleanup outcome. A process-only provider explicitly
skips fresh-container determinism. Subject-emitted records are compared with the
independently collected wire trace.

The Docker suite contains 26 required cases: three provider lifecycle tests,
22 CLI fault/control cases, and one real `echo_env` canary. The hung-step case
checks the episode deadline; the interruption case sends SIGINT only after a
container log confirms the second step has begun. Both must retain the completed
reset/state/step/state prefix and remove their own containers. Each CLI case uses
a unique image label for independent cleanup verification.

The Echo canary copies the actual `envs/echo_env` sources unchanged and records
their hashes. A test overlay adds only the execution declaration, replay plan and
pinned offline image recipe. It runs `echo_message` and `echo_with_length` in one
session and verifies episode identity and state counts 0, 1, 2. Echo currently
returns null step rewards and a reset observation that lacks the advertised
`tool_name` field: the canary therefore expects explicit reward/schema **FAIL**
findings and CLI exit 1. Its passing test means those compatibility findings were
observed correctly; it does not mean Echo passed runtime validation. Inspect
`cli/echo_canary/compatibility-findings.json` for the actual results.

Evidence is written to `outputs/validation-runtime/<run-id>/`, including source,
fixture, lock and wheel hashes; the retained wheelhouse; platform and toolchain
details; test results and bounded logs; provider cleanup evidence; and checksums.
The validation subject never receives a host socket, host credentials or host
directory mount. Tests verify run-owned containers disappear after normal completion,
failed readiness and exec timeout. No global prune is used.

```bash
python scripts/validation/verify_artifacts.py outputs/validation-runtime/<run-id>
```

`--require-complete` requires every selected acceptance test to execute without a
skip. Protocol and Docker runs must also execute every named case in the committed
`acceptance.json`; a nonempty filtered run cannot count as complete. The harness
clears inherited `PYTEST_ADDOPTS` and copies the inventory and its digest into the
bundle. Verify a bundle using its recorded source revision, since later revisions
can add required cases. This checks the implemented slice's inventory, not completion of all RFC
008 checks. A successful image build is not evidence for reproducible-build,
containment or resource-validation graders. Those checks land in later slices.

For changes after the first sync, reinstall the local wheel before fast/protocol
tests: `uv sync --project tests/validation_runtime --frozen --reinstall-package
openenv`. The Docker suite always builds and reinstalls its captured source.
Clean commit runs are the review evidence; dirty developer runs record exact
wheel input hashes and identify themselves as dirty.
