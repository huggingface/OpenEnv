# Jupyter Environment

`jupyter_env` exposes a stateful Jupyter-style Python notebook through MCP
tools. Each episode creates a fresh E2B Code Interpreter sandbox, so Python
variables, imports, files, and generated plots persist across tool calls until
the next reset.

Reset can also receive setup and verify scripts. Setup commands run immediately
after the sandbox is created. Verify commands are stored for the episode and run
when the agent calls `final_answer`.

## Tools

- `add_and_execute_code_cell(code)`: execute a new Python cell.
- `edit_and_execute_current_cell(code)`: replace and re-run the latest code cell.
- `execute_shell_command(command)`: run shell commands inside the sandbox.
- `get_notebook_state(include_images=False)`: summarize recent notebook cells.
- `final_answer(answer)`: record a final answer and run any configured verify
  commands.

## Quick Start

```python
from jupyter_env import JupyterEnv

with JupyterEnv(base_url="http://localhost:8000").sync() as env:
    env.reset(
        setup=["pip install -q pandas"],
        verify=[
            "python - <<'PY'\nfrom pathlib import Path\nassert Path('/home/user/work/answer.txt').exists()\nPY"
        ],
    )
    print(env.call_tool("add_and_execute_code_cell", code="x = 21 * 2\nx"))
    print(env.call_tool("final_answer", answer="done"))
```

## Local Server

```bash
cd envs/jupyter_env
E2B_API_KEY=e2b_... uv run --project . server
```

The API and custom web UI are served on port 8000. The notebook UI is mounted
at `/web`.

## Docker

```bash
cd envs/jupyter_env
openenv build -t jupyter-env
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e E2B_API_KEY=e2b_... jupyter-env
```

## Configuration

- `E2B_API_KEY`: required when resetting an episode.
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_ENVS`: maximum concurrent WebSocket sessions. Defaults to `4`.
- `KAGGLE_DATA_DIR`: optional root directory for reset-time Kaggle file staging.

## Setup and Verify Commands

`reset()` accepts either `setup` / `verify` or `setup_scripts` /
`verify_scripts`.

```python
env.reset(
    setup=[
        "mkdir -p /home/user/work",
        "printf 'seed data' > /home/user/work/input.txt",
    ],
    verify=[
        "test -f /home/user/work/answer.txt",
        "python -m pytest /home/user/work/tests",
    ],
)
```

Setup failure ends the reset response with `done=True` and returns the captured
setup results. Verify commands run when `final_answer(answer)` is called. Reward
defaults to `passed_verify_commands / total_verify_commands`. A verify command
can override this by writing a float to:

```text
/home/user/logs/verifier/reward.txt
```

Verify commands, and the read of that file, run as their own sandbox processes
through E2B's process API, as `root` in `/home/user`, rather than inside the
notebook kernel. A cell can rebind `subprocess.run`, change the working
directory or edit `os.environ`, and none of that reaches verification. This
removes the coupling to the kernel; it does not isolate verification from the
agent. The notebook kernel runs as root in E2B's default code-interpreter
template, so agent code can still change anything in the sandbox, including
the files a verify command reads and the startup files of the shell it runs in.

Only a command that ran and exited decides a verify result. If the sandbox
itself fails — it cannot be reached, the command cannot be started, or the wait
for it ends without an exit status — the error is raised instead: verification
stops, no reward is produced, and the episode does not finish. A sandbox that
is unreachable, expired or unauthenticated says nothing about the agent's work,
and a command with no exit status may still be running, since E2B's kill
signals the command's own process and not the children it started.

## Notes

This first version intentionally keeps sandbox provider selection local to the
environment and uses E2B as the concrete backend. A shared OpenEnv sandbox API
can be introduced later once the provider contract is RFC-backed.
