"""Human-facing UI for a Harbor env server.

Three tabs. **Tasks**: pick a dataset and a task, read it (instruction, files, settings), and run an
agent on it. **Runs**: every rollout this server has run, live or finished, one at a time or two to
four side by side. **Setup**: what this machine can run, and why anything it cannot.

It is a Gradio app, like every OpenEnv UI, with custom HTML components where Gradio has no widget
for the job: the task list (thousands of rows, filtered as you type), the task viewer (a file tree
read on demand), the run card, the run list and the trajectory. Gradio supplies the tabs, the state
and the event wiring.

A rollout uses the endpoint the server was started with, or one the visitor connects in the page: a
Hugging Face token and a model on Inference Providers, or any OpenAI-compatible URL such as vLLM.
Connecting is a gate, not a hint: an endpoint without token-id capture answers every request
normally and returns nothing trainable, so a rollout looks perfect and is worthless for training.
What visitors may do (use the server's endpoint, bring their own, see each other's runs) is set per
deployment; see `ui_settings`.

Every argument that names a dataset is checked against the datasets this server serves or that were
added from the Hub in this process. The UI's handlers are callable by anyone who can load the page,
and a dataset spec that is a local path would otherwise let a browser list and read the server's
own files.

    the visitor's token (or, run locally, this machine's), optionally pinned to one provider or to the
    router's `fastest`/`cheapest` policy. `url`: any OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic endpoint, such as a
    vLLM the visitor runs. Both end in `validate_endpoint`, which probes the endpoint for real.

    Args:
        form (`dict`):
            `source`, and for `hf`: `model`, `route`, `api_key`, `local_token`, `use_account`; for
            `url`: `url`, `model`, `api_key`, `api` (`openai` or `anthropic`), `purpose`.
        account_token (`str`, *optional*):
            The signed-in visitor's Hugging Face token (`inference-api` scope), used when the form
            asks for `use_account`. Gradio reads it from the session; it is never in the form.

    Returns:
        `dict`: the engine, as `validate_endpoint` returns it, with the form (minus the key) under
        `custom` so the card can show what was connected.
