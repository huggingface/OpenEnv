    `HarborTurn.tool_calls` is deliberately flattened: a reward function checking which tool ran should
    not have to walk a wire envelope. But TRL reads `message["tool_calls"]` verbatim, and both
    `has_tool_call` and `apply_chat_template` expect the nested form. Handing over the flat shape makes
    `has_tool_call` false for every turn, so `train_turn_fn=has_tool_call` — the documented default for
    a coding agent — discards the entire rollout while the run still looks healthy. Templates that
    iterate `call.function.name` would raise instead.

    `arguments` is left exactly as captured. It is a JSON *string* on the wire, and TRL's
    `_decode_tool_call_arguments` parses it before rendering, so parsing it here would hand the
    template a dict it does not expect.
