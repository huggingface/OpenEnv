"""Own the sandboxes this process starts: cap how many start at once, stop them on SIGINT/SIGTERM.

Harbor already tears a sandbox down at the end of every trial: `Trial._finalize` shields
`agent_environment.stop()`. Three gaps remain once a run is large enough:

- SIGTERM's default action kills the process before any `finally` runs, so every live sandbox is
  stranded. SIGINT cancels, but `asyncio.run` closes its loop right after, which cancels the shielded
  stop as well.
- Nothing caps how many sandboxes are being created at once. Providers throttle creation well below
  the rollout concurrency a trainer wants, and a throttled create reads as a failed rollout.
- Cancelling a rollout while its sandbox is starting abandons the start mid-flight, and teardown
  then races it. Harbor's docker backend leaves `docker compose up` running when `communicate()` is
  cancelled (only its timeout path terminates the child); a remote backend can finish a create
  request whose handle was dropped. Either way the sandbox can appear after `stop()` has run.

`SandboxSupervisor.adopt(trial)` wraps the trial's own `agent_environment.start/stop`, so Harbor's
lifecycle is unchanged and the supervisor only sees sandboxes this process created.
