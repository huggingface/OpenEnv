"""The unit's phase machine.

A unit is always in exactly one [`Phase`]. Only some actors may cause each
transition: the orchestrator drives the episode, the environment can only say
it's done, and openenvd itself moves the unit when the kernel reports progress
(readiness, `populated 0`, a verdict) or a fault. The agent is not an actor.
