"""The intercept server.

    input   an OpenAI-spec endpoint you already host (vLLM or SGLang) + the served model name
    output  per rollout, a JSON document of exact token ids, logprobs and loss masks, ready to train

In between: a coding agent points at this URL, in whichever wire dialect it speaks, and
nothing about the agent changes except a base URL and an API key.

    agent (in an E2B sandbox, any of ~37)
       |  OPENAI_BASE_URL / ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL / provider config = this server

    THIS  --detect dialect--> normalise to chat --inject capture params--> your engine
       <--replay in the agent's dialect (SSE if it asked for SSE)---------┘
       |
       └─ each call becomes a node in the rollout graph, linked by token prefix

WHY IT CAPTURES FAITHFULLY: we never tokenize. The engine tokenizes each prompt to serve it and hands
back `prompt_token_ids`, so turn k+1's prompt is the canonical tokenization of everything up to that
point, tool results included. Completions come back as sampled ids with aligned logprobs. Stitching
those along a graph path reproduces exactly what the model saw and produced, with no local chat
template involved. See `graph.py`.

TWO ASYMMETRIES, both learned from real failures:

  * **Capture is non-streaming, the reply is whatever the client asked for.** One complete response
    carries ids and logprobs whole; reassembling them from SSE deltas is error-prone in exactly the
    way that silently corrupts training data. But a harness that requested SSE and receives a JSON
    body does not error, it yields nothing: opencode reported `step-finish reason:"unknown"`, zero
    tokens, no error, having been handed a perfectly valid tool call. See `sse.py`.
  * **We validate on ingest, not on export.** A turn whose logprobs are misaligned must be caught
    while we still know which turn it was.

Run:  python -m intercept.server --llm-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --model Qwen3.5-9B

            What is on the other end, for `/health` only. Defaults to `"unknown"` there rather than
            to `"vllm"`: the proxy cannot tell, nothing passes it on the harbor path, and a hosted
            endpoint reported as vLLM reads as a claim about capture that `capture_level` then
            contradicts.
        require_registered (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Reject callers whose API key is not a minted session id. This port may be public.
        max_output_tokens (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `8192`):
            Cap on requested completion length; `0` or `None` disables.
        api_key (`str`, *optional*):
            Credential for the *upstream*. Never the agent-facing key — that one is the session id,
            and the sandbox never sees this value.
        auth_header (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"Authorization"`):

        capture_level (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"tokens"`):
            What the upstream can return, as decided by `validate_llm`. Below `tokens` every rollout
            from this app is an eval rollout.
        admin_key (`str`, *optional*):
            Required by the session-management routes when set. Leave unset for a private port; set it
            whenever this app is reachable from outside, which `serve` does automatically.
        max_model_calls (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `0`):
            Default ceiling on model calls per session; `0` is unlimited, and a session may name its
            own. Once a rollout reaches it the proxy answers a terminal completion itself, which ends
            the agent's loop without recording a turn the model never generated. Worth setting on any
            training deployment: no agent harness honours its own step config (opencode 1.18.30 ran 61
