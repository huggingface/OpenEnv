"""What a rollout hands a trainer.

The mask-aware training contract is `to_trace_entries`: one engine prompt, sampled completion,
behavior logprobs, and a loss mask over prompt+completion per retained model call. Prompt ids and
sampled ids are never reconstructed from text. Masks are authoritative after reconciliation.

`to_turn_records` provides the older three-array tuple for fully supervised completions. It skips
fully masked turns and rejects partial masks because a tuple cannot represent their eligibility.

`measure_retokenization_skew` stays, not as a cost estimate for a re-render you were going to do
anyway, but as the measurement that catches a producer which has quietly stopped emitting ids.

WHAT THIS MODULE CANNOT FILL IN. `TraceEntry` also declares `reward`, and nothing here emits it: a
capture proxy sees model calls, not task outcomes, and inventing a number would be worse than
omitting one. An ENVIRONMENT fills it in from its own `verify()`. `TraceEntry` is `total=False`, so
read it with `.get("reward")` — indexing it raises on every entry this module produces.
