    """
    Collect the fixed replay schedule without replacing the primary transcript.

    Args:
        provider (`ValidationProvider`):
            Provider used for the original subject and optional fresh container.
        running (`RunningSubject`):
            The original subject; its lifetime remains owned by the caller.
        spec (`LaunchSpec`):
            Original immutable image, resource limits and explicit authorization.
        plan (`RuntimePlan`):
            Fixed episode identity, seed, options and public action sequence.
        evidence (`RuntimeEvidence`):
            Independently collected primary episode.
        capabilities (`CapabilitiesSpec`):
            Manifest capabilities; judged rewards require 20 identical-input samples.
        deadline (`float`, *optional*):
            Absolute monotonic deadline set before primary collection. Defaults to
            300 seconds from this call; every collection and launch shares it.

    Returns:
        `RuntimeEvidence`: the original episode plus immutable replay evidence.
